README

This sample program realizes some light effects on a WS2801, WS2812 or WS2812B controlled LED stripe connected to the SPI0 master. You have to configure the program in the kernel.cpp file to meet your configuration before build.

On the Raspberry Pi 2/3 you should disable the #define ARM_ALLOW_MULTI_CORE in include/circle/sysconfig.h if you do not use multiple CPU cores. This is done by default now.

The WS28XX library and sample was initially developed by Arjan van Vught.
