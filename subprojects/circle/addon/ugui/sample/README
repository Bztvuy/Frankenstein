README 

TinyScope Pi is a digital oscilloscope sample for the Raspberry Pi based on the
uGUI library (by Achim Doebler). Its main purpose is to show, how a GUI with
mouse and touch screen support can be implemented on top of Circle. But
TinyScope Pi can be used for simple projects to analyze digital signals too. As
a bare metal application it can provide higher sample rates than similar
solutions using Raspbian.

FEATURES

* 4 Channel digital oscilloscope
* Selectable sample rate up to 15 MHz (on RPi 3)
* Sample duration up to 1 second or 100 KB
* Simple 1-level trigger facility
* Fixed 100 KHz reference clock provided on GPIO 4


BUILDING

TinyScope Pi is based on uGUI, which uses the RGB565 (16 bit) color model on
Circle. That's why you have to change the DEPTH define in
include/circle/screen.h before building like that:

	#define DEPTH	16

Building TinyScope Pi takes place in three steps:

* Building the native Circle libraries using "./makeall" from Circle root
* Building the uGUI library in addon/ugui/ using "make"
* Building the TinyScope Pi sample in addon/ugui/sample/ using "make"

If you want to re-build the libraries or the sample, you should do "./makeall
clean" or "make clean" before. Please have a look on the build notes in the main
Circle README.md too, to know how to configure Circle for your Raspberry Pi
model and toolchain.


USING

To reach the maximum sample rate on the Raspberry Pi 2, 3 and Zero you can add
the following option to the file cmdline.txt on the boot partition of your SD
card:

	fast=true

This will set the CPU clock rate to the allowed maximum for this Raspberry Pi
model. It has no effect on other Raspberry Pi models (A, A+, B, B+).

The input signals for the four oscilloscope channels have to be connected to
GPIO 8, 9, 10 and 11 (Broadcom numbering, in this order). These pins are
normally used for the SPI master in other applications. Don't forget to connect
the ground (GND). See http://elinux.org/RPi_Low-level_peripherals for wiring!
Remember that all input signals must be in a range from 0 to 3.3 Volts!

TinyScope Pi is controlled using an USB mouse or the official Raspberry Pi touch
screen. If an USB mouse is used, it must be connected before the system is
started. The screen resolution is fixed to 800x480 pixels. Your display has to
support this.

When the Raspberry Pi is powered on, the sample recorder is calibrated. This
takes some seconds. After that the TinyScope Pi GUI appears. The oscilloscope
window is still cleared. The control panel looks like that:

	     VERTICAL
	CH1  CH2  CH3  CH4
	 x    x    x    x

	    HORIZONTAL
	 <<   <    >   >>
	 |<   >|   +   -

	     TRIGGER
	CH1 CH2 CH3 CH4
	x   x   x   x ENABLE
	x   x   x   x LEVEL

	     ACQUIRE
	   <  10 MHz  >
	       RUN

When you move the USB mouse the mouse cursor should move on the screen. First
you should select the channels, you want to use ("Ch1" and "Ch2" by default) by
clicking the check-boxes in the VERTICAL section. Next you can choose an
appropriate sample rate from the ACQUIRE section by clicking the "<" and ">"
buttons.

Please note that the actual sample rate differs from the selected value by up to
15%, especially for higher sample rates. This is caused by the implementation of
the sample recorder, which works without additional hardware.

If you need a trigger you can enable the channels used for that purpose in the
"ENABLE" row. If a cross (x) is shown in the "LEVEL" row for an enabled channel,
the signal feed to this channel, must be "high" (otherwise "low") to pass the
trigger point. All enabled trigger channels are checked in parallel. Please note
that a trigger condition which is never passed, may hang the system. There is no
time-out. You have to restart the Raspberry Pi if this happens.

When all configuration is done, you can start the sample recorder with the "RUN"
button. The sample process takes up to one second after the trigger condition
has been passed. The mouse and the touch screen is not use-able in this moment.

When the sample process has been completed, the acquired signals are shown on
the oscilloscope window. Above the chart display the following data is
available:

* SC: Time duration of a scale division (between two vertical white lines)
      in microseconds
* OF: Time offset of the chart at the left window border from the beginning
      of the sample process in microseconds
* TO: Total duration of the sample process in microseconds
* ZO: Zoom factor of the chart display
* FQ: Actual sample rate (frequency) applied (normally differs from the chosen
      rate in the ACQUIRE section by up to 15%)

The displayed signal can be scrolled using the "<" and ">" buttons (by 10
pixels) or the "<<" and ">>" buttons (by 100 pixels). "|<" goes back to the
beginning of the sample, ">|" goes to the end. The "+" button increases the
display zoom (up to 32 times), the "-" button decreases it.
