README

This sample program creates a listing of the files in the root directory of the inserted SD card (WHICH DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY IMPORTANT DATA). The first primary partition of the SD card must be a FAT16 or FAT32 partition. Extended partitions or other file systems are not supported.

After creating the directory listing a file "circle.txt" is created in the root directory and some text is written to it. After closing the file it is re-opened and its contents is read and written to the screen.

The EMMC driver was ported from [https://github.com/jncronin/rpi-boot]. See the notices in emmc.cpp!
