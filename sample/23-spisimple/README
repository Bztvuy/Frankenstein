This sample transfers some data bytes (128 bytes by default) via the SPI0 master to a SPI slave devices and displays the received bytes. You should modify the file kernel.cpp for your needs. For a short test you can connect GPIO9 and GPIO10 (Broadcom numbering) together. The sent data will then also be received.

The pinout of the SPI0 master is as follows:

SCLK	GPIO11
MOSI	GPIO10
MISO	GPIO9
CE0	GPIO8
CE1	GPIO7

On the Raspberry Pi 2/3 you should disable the #define ARM_ALLOW_MULTI_CORE in include/circle/sysconfig.h if you do not use multiple CPU cores. This is done by default now.
