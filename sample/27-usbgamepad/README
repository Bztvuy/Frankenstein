README

This sample displays the controls of an attached USB gamepad. On start-up an
information about the available controls (buttons, axes and hats) is shown and
later, when you push a button or move an axis or hat, the current position
status of all controls is displayed.

Circle currently supports only gamepads with a standard USB HID class report
interface (3-0-0). That's why some widely spread gamepads with proprietary
interfaces cannot be used. There are also USB gamepads out, which support this
standard report interface but do not have a fully qualified report descriptor.
It is likely that their support is limited to some gamepad controls.

Please note that the gamepad API may change in the future if further gamepads
will be supported.
