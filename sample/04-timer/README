First blink 5 times to show the image was loaded right. After initializing most things the timer interrupt is on and the delay loop will be calibrated. A kernel timer is started to elapse after 15 seconds. Furthermore a log message is generated on every second.

When the kernel timer elapses TimerHandler() is called where a "Prefetch Abort" is generated by jumping to an invalid address (execute never bit is set in the page table for it). Alternatively you can generate an "Undefined Instruction" exception. This is for demonstrating the exception handler.
