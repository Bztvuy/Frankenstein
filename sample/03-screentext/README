MMU and frame buffer are on by default now. First blink 5 times to show the image was loaded right. Write character set to screen. Write some logging messages to screen or UART. debug_hexdump() of the starting bytes of the ATAG structure at 0x100. Show usage of assert() and stack-trace.

You can create a file cmdline.txt like this on the SD(HC) card to change the frame buffer size:

width=640 height=480

In the same file you can control the logging feature by these options (append them to the same line):

logdev=ttyS1 loglevel=4

(write logging messages to UART now, default is to screen ("tty1"), the loglevel controls the amount of messages produced (0: only panic, 1: also errors, 2: also warnings, 3: also notices, 4: also debug output (default))
