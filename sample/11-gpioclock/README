README 

This sample program shows the usage of GPIO clocks and provides a little sampling routine. GPIO clock 0 is initialized to generate an 125 KHz square wave signal on GPIO pin 4. The signal on GPIO pin 18 is sampled with a sampling rate of some MHz and displayed on the screen afterwards. If you connect both pins you can see the square wave.

If you want to run this sample on the Raspberry Pi 2/3 you should undefine ARM_ALLOW_MULTI_CORE in include/circle/sysconfig.h before build. This has much influence on the available sampling rate. This is done by default now.
